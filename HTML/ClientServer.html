        <p><b>Client–server model</b> is a distributed application structure that partitions tasks or workloads between
            the
            providers of a resource or service, called servers, and service requesters, called clients. [1] Often
            clients
            and servers communicate over a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer">computer</a> network on
            separate
            hardware, but both <span>client</span> and <span>server</span> may reside in
            the same system. A server host runs one or more server programs, which share their resources with clients. A
            client usually does not share any of its resources, but it requests content or service from a server.
            Clients,
            therefore, initiate communication sessions with servers, which await incoming requests. Examples of computer
            applications that use the client–server model are email, network printing, and the World Wide Web.</p>

        <p>The "client–server" characteristic describes the relationship of cooperating programs in an application. The
            server component provides a function or service to one or many clients, which initiate requests for such
            services. Servers are classified by the services they provide. For example, a web server serves web pages
            and a
            file server serves computer files. A shared resource may be any of the server computer's software and
            electronic
            components, from programs and data to processors and storage devices. The sharing of resources of a server
            constitutes a service.</p>
        <p>Whether a computer is a client, a server, or both, is determined by the nature of the application that
            requires
            the service functions. For example, a single computer can run web server and file server software at the
            same
            time to serve different data to clients making different kinds of requests. Client software can also
            communicate
            with server software within the same computer.[2] Communication between servers, such as to synchronize
            data, is
            sometimes called inter-server or server-to-server communication.</p>
