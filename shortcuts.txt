Windows shortcuts

Windows + Tab	Launch Windows 10 Task View
Windows + L	Lock your Windows 10 device
Windows + Ctrl + D	Create new virtual desktop
Windows + Ctrl + F4	Close current virtual desktop
Windows + Ctrl + [Left][Right]	Switch between virtual desktops
Windows + [Left][Right][Up][Down]	Position windows on your screenE.g. Windows + [Left] moves the current window to the left half of your screen. If you use Windows + [Up] afterward, the current window will be placed in the upper left quarter of your screen.And, what’s very handy in my opinion: If you release the Windows key after positioning a window, Task View shows up on the opposite side of the positioned window to select and position another app.
Windows + D	Show Windows desktop
Windows + E	Open File Explorer
Windows + R	Run a command
Alt + F4	a) Close current window.  b) If you’re on your Windows 10 desktop, open Power dialogue to shut down or restart Windows, put your device in sleep mode, or sign out or switch the current user.

	The > character is the redirect operator. This takes the output from the preceding command that you’d normally see in the terminal and sends it to a file that you give it. As an example, take echo “contents of file1” > file1. Here it creates a file called file1 and puts the echoed string into it
